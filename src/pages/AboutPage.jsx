          This is a project that allows anyone to help our smaller brothers.
          <br />
          How? <br />
          On the homepage, you can choose any pet that you like. Then, by
          clicking the "Adopt" button, you fill in some basic information about
          yourself.
          <br /> After that, we will contact you for further arrangements.
          <br />
          Also, if you find an animal on the street and are unable to keep it at
          home, but would like to help find it a family, you can use our
          website.
          <br /> Simply go to the "Add Animal" section from the homepage and
          fill in all the required information about the pet.
